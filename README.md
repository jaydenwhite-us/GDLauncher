# The NAMT GDLauncher Challenge

## Getting Started

Run `cargo doc --open`, `cargo test`, and `cargo bench` before opening the code base if you wish to quickly understand the various iterations and their strengths and weaknesses.

Run `cargo run` in `../namt_preventative/src`. All paths are relative to using `../src` as the working director.
