# The NAMT GDLauncher Challenge

## Getting Started

Run `cargo doc --open`, `cargo test`, and `cargo bench` before opening the code base if you wish to quickly understand the various iterations and their strengths and weaknesses.

If `cargo run` cannot find a file for a module, navigate into `../target_module/src`. All paths are relative to using `../src` as the working director.
